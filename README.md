### Source code of dead body stay v3 warno 

----

I see your requests about update this mod.
But game updating too often. I do not have time to update this mod to every game version. 
3 days ago i began to work on update, but yesterday game was updated another time. 
May be game developers should add options to support old mods, 
like in other games, i.e. project zomboid & blade sorcerry or like in garrys mod, 
because i don't think modders have that much time to update mods for each 
game version.
